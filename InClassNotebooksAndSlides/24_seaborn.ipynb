    "Earlier in this semester some fellow students have already introduced you to Seaborn, a libary to make statistical visualizations of data.  We will spend a little more time using this library to explore a dataset of water samples from Gordon Gulch, west of Boulder.  This data was collected by CU Boulder goegraphy masters student Maggie Burns and her advisor, Holly Barnard.  The data is available here: https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/25ba8374892541c4bfe0c9cf18f520ca/  \n",
