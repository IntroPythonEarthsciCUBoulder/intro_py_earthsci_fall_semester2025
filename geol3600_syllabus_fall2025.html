<p><span class="s1"><strong>Course Description</strong></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Computer programming is virtually indispensable in modern geoscience. This course provides an introduction to scientific computer programming using the Python language. After completing this course, you will be able to:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
    <li class="li5"><span class="s1">Write a computer program in Python to solve a common scientific problem such as reading in and plotting data, analyzing a dataset by performing calculations on its values, or performing calculations using a mathematical model.</span></li>
    <li class="li5"><span class="s1">Explain the basic elements of the Python programming language, such as variables, data types, operations, and functions.</span></li>
    <li class="li5"><span class="s1">Use common scientific packages such as NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib.</span></li>
    <li class="li5"><span class="s1">Understand and modify scientific Python scripts written by others.</span></li>
    <li class="li5"><span class="s1">Draw on a portfolio of well-documented programming examples created during the semester for examples and reminders of how to write Python code for various types of application.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The material will be motivated using various geoscientific problems that involve programming.</span></p>
<p><span class="s1"><strong>Required Work and Grading</strong></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Work for the course includes:</span></p>
<ul>
    <li class="p2"><span class="s1">Five "code paper" assignments (10% each)<br /></span></li>
    <li class="p2"><span class="s1">Daily in-class notebook work (20%) (note: you can miss a few of these without any grade penalty)</span></li>
    <li class="p2"><span class="s1">A lightning presentation and accompanying slide about a Python package of your choice (5%)</span></li>
    <li class="p2"><span class="s1">A final project (presentation and report) (25%)</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Code paper and in-class work will be done using Jupyter Notebooks. A Jupyter Notebook is an interactive document that you create and edit through a web browser. Notebooks can combine text, pictures, nicely formatted math, Python code, and plots. This combination makes them really useful for the work in this course. The first session will introduce you to Jupyter Notebooks. </span><span class="s1">Papers should be turned in electronically, in the form of the notebook file, and are due by midnight on the given due date.</span></p>

<h2>Use of AI tools</h2>
<p>"Don't copy code that you don't understand."</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence (AI)-based Large Language Models (LLMs), like ChatGPT, Gemini, etc., have become popular tools for coding help (among other things). But to use them effectively and reliably, you really need to understand the fundamentals of programming; otherwise, you're likely to end up with code that doesn't work or is full of errors.</p>
<p>In this course, the general philosophy is that LLMs are here to stay, and it's worth knowing how to use them, but they should never get in the way of learning.</p>
<p>To that end, unless otherwise noted, use of LLMs in programming assignments will be permitted as long as you follow two principles: show that you <strong>understand your computer code</strong>, and <strong>include an explanation of what tool you used, and how you used it</strong>. (I'll elaborate on this more in class.)</p>

<p>Members of the CU Boulder community and visitors to campus must follow university, department, and building health and safety requirements and all public health orders to reduce the risk of spreading infectious diseases.</p>
<p>The CU Boulder campus is currently mask optional. However, if masks are again required in classrooms, students who fail to adhere to masking requirements will be asked to leave class. Students who do not leave class when asked or who refuse to comply with these requirements will be referred to Student Conduct &amp; Conflict Resolution. Students who require accommodation because a disability prevents them from fulfilling safety measures related to infectious disease will be asked to follow the steps in the &ldquo;Accommodation for Disabilities&rdquo; statement on this syllabus.</p>
<p>For those who feel ill and think you might have COVID-19 or if you have tested positive for COVID-19, please stay home and follow the <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/healthcenter/coronavirus-updates/symptoms-and-what-do-if-you-feel-sick">further guidance of the Public Health Office</a>. For those who have been in close contact with someone who has COVID-19 but do not have any symptoms and have not tested positive for COVID-19, you do not need to stay home.</p>

<p>Students and faculty are responsible for maintaining an appropriate learning environment in all instructional settings, whether in person, remote, or online. Failure to adhere to such behavioral standards may be subject to discipline. Professional courtesy and sensitivity are especially important with respect to individuals and topics dealing with race, color, national origin, sex, pregnancy, age, disability, creed, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, veteran status, political affiliation, or political philosophy.<br /><br />For more information, see the <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/policies/student-classroom-and-course-related-behavior">classroom behavior policy</a>, the<a href="https://www.colorado.edu/sccr/student-conduct"> </a><a href="https://www.colorado.edu/sccr/student-conduct">Student Code of Conduct</a>, and the<a href="https://www.colorado.edu/oiec/"> </a><a href="https://www.colorado.edu/oiec/">Office of Institutional Equity and Compliance</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.colorado.edu/disabilityservices/">Disability Services</a> determines accommodations based on documented disabilities in the academic environment. If you qualify for accommodations because of a disability, submit your accommodation letter from Disability Services to your faculty member in a timely manner so your needs can be addressed.

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If you have a temporary medical condition or required medical isolation for which you require accommodation, please let one of the instructors or the TA know (by email or in person).

<p>CU Boulder recognizes that students' legal information doesn't always align with how they identify.

<p>All incidents of academic misconduct will be reported to Student Conduct &amp; Conflict Resolution: <a href="mailto:honor@colorado.edu">honor@colorado.edu</a>, 303-492-5550. Students found responsible for violating the<a href="https://www.colorado.edu/sccr/honor-code"> </a><a href="https://www.colorado.edu/sccr/honor-code">Honor Code</a> will be assigned resolution outcomes from the Student Conduct &amp; Conflict Resolution as well as be subject to academic sanctions from the faculty member.
