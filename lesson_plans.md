# Lesson plans for GEOL 3600, fall 2025

## Class 1: introduction and overview

### Main topics

- Introduction to course
- Basics of computers: bits and bytes
- Programming languages, and Python
- How to log onto JupyterHub
- Basics of notebooks: markdown, code, LaTeX
- Quick overview of earth history (for coming exercise)

### LP

- Initial hello, ask them about temperature outside, age of earth, speed of tectonic plate; point out nature as numbers; slide with 3 examples
- Introduction of instructors (optional: ask students about their motivation to be here, ask about coding experience) (5 min)
- Mini-lecture on computing in geoscience (10 min)
- Intro to course and syllabus (10)
- Intro to notebooks (5)
- Ex: log on to lab computers, then onto J-hub; sort out any issues (5)
- Overview of the Lab environment: file browser, tools, tabs window (5)
- Overview of J notebooks (5)
- Open daily notebook and do exercise of name, date, note to self about the Python print() function, and hello world (5)
  - Directions: make a new notebook, give it a name that includes today's date.
  - Make a text cell that has a 1st-level heading "Getting started", name, and date
  - Make a new text cell, give it a 2nd-level heading "The Python print() function", then write a note to your future self about what the function does.
  - Make a new code cell with a print("Hello, world!") and run it
- Live guided exercise on LaTeX math, with inline ($g=9.8$ meters per second squared) ($\pi$), own line ($$A_c = \pi r^2$$, $$A_s = 4 \pi r^2$$) (10)
  - Make a new text cell with the 2nd-level header "LaTeX math"
  - Write some expressions or equations, including at least one subscript, one superscript, and Greek symbol, one fraction, and one square root. Include at least one example of an inline equation, and one example of an equation on a line by itself.
- Optional: mini-lecture on geologic time by powers of ten (10)
- Wrap up and recap (5)

## Class 2: operators

### Main topics

#### Computing

- Use **operators** to do mathematical calculations
- Understand how computer data are organized using **files** and **folders**
- Navigate among folders using a **UNIX shell** (otherwise known as a *terminal*)
- Learn how computers represent numerical data

#### Geoscience

- Define solar irradiance and albedo
- Identify the Stefan-Boltzmann law
- Use the Stefan-Boltzmann law to calculate the effective radiating temperature of earth given irradiance and albedo
